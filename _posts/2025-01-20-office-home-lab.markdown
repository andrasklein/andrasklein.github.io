1. Go to the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/) to download the ISO files for:
   - Windows Server 2022
   - Windows 10 Workstations (64-bit editions)

2. Fill out the trial form to register. 
   - **Note**: You can input any information, as the form will work regardless of accuracy.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Domain Controller

The domain controller will be configured using **Windows Server 2022**. Follow these steps to set up the virtual machine:


1. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - Use your preferred virtualization platform.
   - Select the downloaded Windows Server 2022 ISO file.

2. **Allocate Storage**:
   - Choose a drive that provides enough storage to meet the lab requirements.
   - Split the virtual disk into multiple files to allow it to grow as you add more files later.

## Step 4: Setting Up the Workstation Machines

1. **Create Virtual Machines for Workstations**:
   - Use the ISO file for **Windows 10**.
   - Go through the setup process and choose a name for each machine that matches your theme.  
     - Example: **DWIGHT** and **AND**.

![b](/images/images-office/image30.png)



2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial setup procedure is the same as with the Windows Server:
     - Allocate an appropriate amount of RAM based on your host machine's capacity.
     - Power on the virtual machines and proceed with the setup.

3. **Domain Login Setup**:
   - During the setup process, when prompted to log in with Microsoft:
     - Choose **Domain joined** instead.
     - Assign names for the workstations.  
       - Example: **Andy Bernard** and **Jim Halpert**.
     - Set up passwords for both users.
